## Overview

dartR is a user-friendly R package that provides in the same platform a wide range of analyses and pipelines along with strong user support through quality tutorials and documentation. 

## Installation

dartR is on CRAN, so to install it simply type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dartR")
library(dartR)
```

You can use the function gl.install.vanilla.dartR to install all the packages that are used by dartR.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gl.install.vanilla.dartR()
```

You can install the development version of dartR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
gl.install.vanilla.dartR(flavour = "dev")
```

Please consult [this installation tutorial][installation_tutorial] if you run into any problems during setup.

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dartR)
## basic example code
```

## Getting started

Are you a R rookie? If you want to learn R and RStudio without any fuss, have a look at our [R-refresher tutorial][intro_tutorial].

Let's get started by reading your genetic data into dartR; if you have DArT data, follow [this tutorial][input_tutorial_1]; if not, follow [this one][input_tutorial_2].

Checking out our [data manipulation tutorial][data_tutorial] is the easiest way to get your feet wet with dartR.

[This tutorial][filtering_tutorial] will provide some pointers on how to filter your data properly, an important step that depends on making sound threshold assessments.

## Getting help 

Q&A forum in support of users can be accessed [here][google_groups].

There are two main places to get help with R and R-Studio:

1.  The [RStudio community][community] is a friendly place to ask any question.

1.  [Stack Overflow][so] is a great source of answers to common questions.

## Contribute 

If you want to help shape the future of dartR, [this tutorial][developer_tutorial] is for you.

## Citation 

Please acknowledge dartR if you use it in your study. Enter the following in the R console to retrieve the citation information:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citation("dartR")
```

Have fun working with dartR!
