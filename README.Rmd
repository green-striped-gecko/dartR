## Overview

dartR is a user-friendly R package that delivers a variety of analyses and pipelines on the same platform, as well as excellent user support via high-quality tutorials and documentation.

dartR is a collaboration between the University of Canberra, CSIRO and Diversity Arrays Technology, and is supported with funding from the ACT Priority Investment Program, CSIRO and the University of Canberra.

## Installation

dartR is on CRAN, so to install it simply type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dartR")
```

You can use the function gl.install.vanilla.dartR to install all the packages that are used by dartR.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gl.install.vanilla.dartR()
```

You can install the development version of dartR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
gl.install.vanilla.dartR(flavour = "dev")
```

Please consult [this installation tutorial][installation_tutorial] if you run into any problems during setup.

## Usage

dartR provides several functions for handling all the steps involved in genetic data analysis, from reading multiple data input formats to manipulating, filtering, exploring and analysing the data.

<p align="center">
<img src='man/figures/Figure_1.png' width="800"/>
</p>

We use the prefix ‘gl’ in function names to acknowledge the use of the genlight object from package [adegenet][adegenet] as our input format. 

In most cases, the following term in the function name indicates a subset of functions. 

Similarly, in most cases the first function parameter (input) is the genlight object. 

For instance, you might use the code below to generate a report and then filter your data based on the percentage of missing data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dartR)
test <- platypus.gl
rep <- gl.report.callrate(test)
test_1 <- gl.filter.callrate(test)
```

## Getting started

1. Are you a R rookie? If you want to learn R and RStudio without any fuss, have a look at our [R-refresher tutorial][intro_tutorial].

2. Let's get started by reading your genetic data into dartR; if you have DArT data, follow [this tutorial][input_tutorial_1]; if not, follow [this one][input_tutorial_2].

3. Checking out our [data manipulation tutorial][data_tutorial] is the easiest way to get your feet wet with dartR.

4. [This tutorial][filtering_tutorial] will provide some pointers on how to filter your data effectively, an important step that depends on making sound threshold assessments.

5. Check out our [simulations tutorial][sim_tutorial] to learn more about our simulation model, a powerful tool for illuminating intricate evolutionary and genetic processes.

## Getting help 

1.  Google groups Q&A forum in support of users can be accessed [here][google_groups].

2. The [RStudio community][community] provides a welcoming environment in which to ask any enquiry.

3. Answers to frequently asked topics may usually be found on [Stack Overflow][so].

## Citation 

Please acknowledge dartR if you use it in your study. Copy the following to the R console to retrieve the citation information:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citation("dartR")
```
