#' Calculates the Hamming distance between two DArT trimmed DNA sequences
#'
#' Hamming distance is calculated as the number of base differences between two
#' sequences which can be expressed as a count or a proportion. Typically, it is
#' calculated between two sequences of equal length. In the context of DArT
#' trimmed sequences, which differ in length but which are anchored to the left
#' by the restriction enzyme recognition sequence, it is sensible to compare the
#' two trimmed sequences starting from immediately after the common recognition
#' sequence and terminating at the last base of the shorter sequence.
#'
#' The Hamming distance between the rows of a matrix can be computed quickly
#' by exploiting the fact that the dot product of two binary vectors x and (1-y)
#' counts the corresponding elements that are different between x and y.
#' This matrix multiplication can also be used for matrices with more than two
#' possible values, and different types of elements, such as DNA sequences.
#'
#' The function calculates the Hamming distance between all columns of a
#' matrix X, or two matrices X and Y. Again matrix multiplication is used, this
#' time for counting, between two columns x and y, the number of cases in which
#' corresponding elements have the same value (e.g. A, C, G or T). This counting
#' is done for each of the possible values individually, while iteratively adding
#' the results. The end result of the iterative adding is the sum of all
#' corresponding elements that are the same, i.e. the inverse of the Hamming
#' distance. Therefore, the last step is to subtract this end result H from the
#' maximum possible distance, which is the number of rows of matrix X.
#'
#' If the two DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated. The
#' initial common restriction enzyme recognition sequence is ignored.
#'
#' The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong
