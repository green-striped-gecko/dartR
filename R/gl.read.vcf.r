#' Converts a vcf file into a genlight object
#'
#' This function needs package vcfR. At the time of writing (August 2020) the package was no longer available from CRAN. To install the package check their github repository. \url{https://github.com/knausb/vcfR}. 
#' Once installed uncomment and run with installed=TRUE
#' @param vcffile -- a vcf file (works only for diploid data)
#' @param verbose set to 2
#' @param installed switch to run the function once vcfR package is installed
#' @return A genlight object, with most slots filled.
# @importFrom vcfR read.vcfR vcfR2genlight
#' @export
