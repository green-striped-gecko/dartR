\title{Calculate a distance matrix for populations defined in an \{adegenet\} genlight object}
\usage{
gl.dist.pop(
  x,
  method = "euclidean",
  plot = TRUE,
  boxplot = "standard",
  range = 1.5,
  binary = FALSE,
  p = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight containing the SNP genotypes [required]}

\item{method}{-- Specify distance measure [euclidean]}

\item{plot}{-- if TRUE, display a histogram of the genetic distances, and a whisker plot [TRUE]}

\item{boxplot}{-- if 'standard', plots a standard box and whisker plot; if 'adjusted',
plots a boxplot adjusted for skewed distributions ['standard']}

\item{range}{-- specifies the range for delimiting outliers [1.5 interquartile ranges]}

\item{binary}{-- Perform presence/absence standardization before analysis using decostand [FALSE]}

\item{p}{-- The power of the Minkowski distance (typically a value ranging from 0.25 to infinity) [0.5]}

\item{verbose}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity]}
}
\value{
An object of class 'dist' giving distances between populations
}
\description{
This script calculates various distances between populations based on allele frequencies. The distances are
calculated by scripts in the {stats} or {vegan} libraries, with the exception of the pcfixed (percent fixed
differences) distance.
}
\details{
The distance measure can be one of "manhattan", "euclidean", "pcfixed", "pa", canberra", "bray", 
"kulczynski", "jaccard", "gower", "morisita", "horn", "mountford", "raup" , 
"binomial", "chao", "cao", "mahalanobis", "maximum", "binary" or "minkowski". Refer to the documentation for
dist stats or vegdist vegan for definitions. 

Distance pcfixed calculates the pair-wise count of fixed allelic differences between populations.
