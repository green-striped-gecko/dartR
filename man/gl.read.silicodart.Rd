\title{Imports presence/absence data from SilicoDArT to genlight \{agegenet\}
format (ploidy=1)}
\usage{
gl.read.silicodart(
  filename,
  ind.metafile = NULL,
  nas = "-",
  topskip = NULL,
  lastmetric = "Reproducibility",
  probar = TRUE,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Name of csv file containing the SilicoDArT data [required].}

\item{ind.metafile}{Name of csv file containing metadata assigned to each
entity (individual) [default NULL].}

\item{nas}{Missing data character [default '-'].}

\item{topskip}{Number of rows to skip before the header row (containing the
specimen identities) [optional].}

\item{lastmetric}{Specifies the last non genetic column (Default is
'Reproducibility'). Be sure to check if that is true, otherwise the number of
individuals will not match. You can also specify the last column by a number
 [default "Reproducibility"].}

\item{probar}{Show progress bar [default TRUE].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2, or as set by gl.set.verbose()].}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{genlight} with ploidy set to 1, containing
the presence/absence data, and locus and individual metadata.
}
\description{
DaRT provide the data as a matrix of entities (individual animals) across the
 top and attributes (P/A of sequenced fragment) down the side in a format
 that is unique to DArT. This program reads the data in to adegenet format
 for consistency with other programming activity. The script may require
 modification as DArT modify their data formats from time to time.
}
\details{
gl.read.silicodart() opens the data file (csv comma delimited) and skips the
first n=topskip lines. The script assumes that the next line contains the
entity labels (specimen ids) followed immediately by the SNP data for the
first locus.

It reads the presence/absence data into a matrix of 1s and 0s, and inputs the
 locus metadata and specimen metadata. The locus metadata comprises a series
 of columns of values for each locus including the essential columns of
 CloneID and the desirable variables Reproducibility and PIC. Refer to
  documentation provide by DArT for an explanation of these columns.

The specimen metadata provides the opportunity to reassign specimens to
 populations, and to add other data relevant to the specimen. The key
 variables are id (specimen identity which must be the same and in the same
 order as the SilicoDArT file, each unique), pop (population assignment), lat
 (latitude, optional) and lon (longitude, optional). id, pop, lat, lon are
 the column headers in the csv file. Other optional columns can be added.

The data matrix, locus names (forced to be unique), locus metadata, specimen
 names, specimen metadata are combined into a genind object. Refer to the
 documentation for \{adegenet\} for further details.
