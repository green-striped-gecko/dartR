\title{Creates a proforma recode_ind file for reassigning individual
 (=specimen) names}
\usage{
gl.make.recode.ind(
  x,
  out.recode.file = "default_recode_ind.csv",
  outpath = tempdir(),
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required].}

\item{out.recode.file}{File name of the output file (including extension)
[default default_recode_ind.csv].}

\item{outpath}{Path where to save the output file
[default tempdir(), mandated by CRAN]. Use outpath=getwd() or outpath='.'
when calling this function to direct output files to your working directory.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A vector containing the new individual names.
}
\description{
Renaming individuals may be required when there have been errors in
labelling arising in the process from sample to DArT files. There may be
occasions where renaming individuals is required for preparation of figures.
Caution needs to be exercised because of the potential for breaking the
'chain of evidence' between the samples themselves and the analyses. Recoding
individuals can be done with a recode table (csv).
}
\details{
This script facilitates the construction of a recode table by producing a
 proforma file with current individual (=specimen) names in two identical
 columns. Edit the second column to reassign individual names. Use keyword
 Delete to delete an individual.

Apply the recoding using gl.recode.ind(). Deleting individuals can
potentially generate monomorphic loci or loci with all values missing. Clean
this up with gl.filter.monomorphic().
