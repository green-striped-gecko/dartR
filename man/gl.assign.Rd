\description{
This script assigns an individual of unknown provenance to one or more target populations based on first, an analysis
of private alleles, and then, if the assignment remains ambigous, on the basis of a weighted likelihood index.
}
\details{
The algorithm first identifies those target populations for which the individual has no private alleles. If no single 
population emerges from this analysis, or if a higher threshold than 0 is chosen for the number of tollerable private
alleles, then the following process is followed.
(a) The space defined by the loci is ordinated to yield a series of orthogonal axes (independent), a necessary condition
for combining likelihoods calculated from each axis.
(b) A workable subset of dimensions is chosen, normally equal to the number of target populations or the number of dimensions
with substantive eigenvalues, whichever is the smaller. 
(c) The log-likelihood of the value for the unknown on each axis is calculated, weighted by the eigenvalue for that axis, 
and summed over all dimensions as an assignment index. The assignment index is calculated for a point on the boundary of
the 95% (or as specified) confidence envelope.

There are three considerations to the assignment. First, consider only those populations for which the unknown has no
private alleles. Private alleles are an indication that the unknown does not belong to a target population (provided that
the sample size is adequate, say >=10). 

Second, consider the PCoA plot for populations where no private alleles have been
detected and the position of the unknown in relation to the confidence ellipses. Note, this is considering only the 
top two dimensions of the ordination, and so an unknown lying outside the confidence ellipse can be interpreted as it lying 
outside the confidence envelope. However, if the unknown lies inside the confidence ellipse in two dimensions, then it may still lie outside
the confidence envelope. This is good for eliminating populations from consideration, but does not provide confidence in
assignment. 

Third, consider the assignment probabilities. This approach calculates the squared Generalised Linear Distance (Mahalanobis
distance) of the unknown from the centroid for each population, and calculates the probability associated with its quantile
under the zero truncated normal distribution. This index takes into account position of the unknown in relation to the 
confidence envelope in all selected dimensions of the ordination.

Each of these approaches provides evidence, none are 100% definitive. They need to be interpreted cautiously.
