\title{Filters loci that show significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium}
\usage{
gl.filter.hwe(gl, p = 0.05, basis = "any", bon = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gl}{-- a genlight object containing the SNP genotypes [Required]}

\item{p}{-- level of significance (per locus) [Default 0.05]}

\item{bon}{-- apply bonferroni correction to significance levels for filtering [default TRUE]}

\item{pop}{-- basis for filtering out loci (any, HWE departure in any one population) [default basis="any"]}
}
\value{
a genlight object with the loci departing significantly from HWE removed
}
\description{
Calculates the probabilities of agreement with H-W equilibrium based on observed
frequencies of reference homozygotes, heterozygotes and alternate homozygotes. 
Uses the exact calculations contained in function prob.hwe() as developed by
Wigginton, JE, Cutler, DJ, and Abecasis, GR.
}
\details{
Input is a genlight {adegenet} object containing SNP genotypes (0 homozygous for reference SNP, 
1 heterozygous, 2 homozygous for alternate SNP).

Loci are filtered if they show HWE departure in any one population.
Note that power to detect departures from HWE is affected by sample size and that
effective filtering may require substantial sample sizes (n > 20).
