\title{Converts a genlight object to nexus format PAUP SVDquartets}
\usage{
gl2svdquartets(
  x,
  outfile = "svd.nex",
  outpath = tempdir(),
  method = 2,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data or tag P/A data
[required].}

\item{outfile}{File name of the output file (including extension)
[default 'svd.nex'].}

\item{outpath}{Path where to save the output file
[default tempdir(), mandated by CRAN]. Use outpath=getwd() when calling this
function or set.tempdir <- getwd() elsewhere in your script to direct output
 files to your working directory.}

\item{method}{Method = 1, nexus file with two lines per individual; method =
2, nexus file with one line per individual, ambiguity codes for SNP
genotypes, 0 or 1 for presence/absence data [default 2].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity]}
}
\value{
returns no value (i.e. NULL)
}
\description{
The output nexus file contains the SNP data in one of two forms, depending
upon what you regard as most appropriate. One form, that used by Chifman and
 Kubatko, has two lines per individual, one providing the reference SNP the
  second providing the alternate SNP (method=1).
}
\details{
A second form, recommended by Dave Swofford, has a single line per
  individual, resolving heterozygous SNPs by replacing them with standard
ambiguity codes (method=2).

If the data are tag presence/absence, then method=2 is assumed.
