\title{Calculate a similarity(distance) matrix for individuals on the proportion of shared alleles}
\usage{
gl.propShared(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight containing the SNP genotypes [required]}
}
\description{
This script calculates a individual based distance matrix. It uses an C++ implementation, so package Rcpp needs to be installed and it is therefore really fast (once it has compiled the function after the first run).
}
\examples{
#takes some time at the first run of the function...
\dontrun{
res <- gl.propShared(bandicoot.gl)
res[1:5,1:7] #show only a small part of the matrix
}
}
