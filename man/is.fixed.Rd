\title{Tests if two populations are fixed at a given locus}
\usage{
is.fixed(s1, s2, tloc = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{Percentage SNP allele or sequence tag frequency for the first 
population [required].}

\item{s2}{Percentage SNP allele or sequence tag frequency for the second 
population [required].}

\item{tloc}{Threshold value for tolerance in when a difference is regarded as
fixed [default 0].}
}
\value{
TRUE (fixed difference) or FALSE (alleles shared) or NA (one or both 
s1 or s2 missing)
}
\description{
This script compares two percent allele frequencies
and reports TRUE if they represent a fixed difference, FALSE otherwise.
}
\details{
A fixed difference at a locus occurs when two populations share no alleles,
 noting that SNPs are biallelic (ploidy=2).
Tolerance in the definition of a fixed difference is provided by the t
 parameter. For example, t=0.05 means that SNP allele frequencies of 95,5 and
 5,95 percent will be reported as fixed (TRUE).
