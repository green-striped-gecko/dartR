\title{Concatenates DArT trimmed sequences and outputs a FASTA file}
\usage{
gl2fasta(
  x,
  method = 1,
  outfile = "output.fasta",
  outpath = tempdir(),
  probar = FALSE,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required].}

\item{method}{One of 1 | 2 | 3 | 4. Type method=0 for a list of options 
[method=1].}

\item{outfile}{Name of the output file (fasta format) ["output.fasta"].}

\item{outpath}{Path where to save the output file (set to tempdir by default)}

\item{probar}{If TRUE, a progress bar will be displayed for long loops 
[default = TRUE].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report 
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A new gl object with all loci rendered homozygous.

\description{
Concatenated sequence tags are useful for phylogenetic methods where
information on base frequencies and transition and transversion ratios are
required (for example, Maximum Likelihood methods). Where relevant,
heterozygous loci are resolved before concatenation by either assigning
 ambiguity codes or by random allele assignment.
}
\details{
Four methods are employed:

Method 1 -- heterozygous positions are replaced by the standard ambiguity c
odes. The resultant sequence fragments are concatenated across loci to
generate a single combined sequence to be used in subsequent ML phylogenetic
analyses.

Method 2 -- the heterozygous state is resolved by randomly assigning one or
the other SNP variant to the individual. The resultant sequence fragments are
concatenated across loci to generate a single composite haplotype to be used
in subsequent ML phylogenetic analyses.

Method 3 -- heterozygous positions are replaced by the standard ambiguity
codes. The resultant SNP bases are concatenated across loci to generate a
single combined sequence to be used in subsequent MP phylogenetic analyses.

Method 4 -- the heterozygous state is resolved by randomly assigning one or
the other SNP variant to the individual. The resultant SNP bases are
concatenated across loci to generate a single composite haplotype to be used
in subsequent MP phylogenetic analyses.

Trimmed sequences for which the SNP has been trimmed out, rarely, by adapter
 mis-identity are deleted.

The script writes out the composite haplotypes for each individual as a
fastA file. Requires 'TrimmedSequence' to be among the locus metrics
(\code{@other$loc.metrics}) and information of the type of alleles (slot
loc.all e.g. 'G/A') and the position of the SNP in slot position of the
 ```genlight``` object (see testset.gl@position and testset.gl@loc.all for
 how to format these slots.)
