\title{A utility script to reset to FALSE (or TRUE) the locus metric flags after
some individuals or populations have been deleted.}
\usage{
utils.reset.flags(x, set = FALSE, value = 2, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data or
tag presence/absence data (SilicoDArT) [required].}

\item{set}{Set the flags to TRUE or FALSE [default FALSE].}

\item{value}{Set the default verbosity for all functions, where verbosity is
not specified [default 2].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default NULL].}
}
\value{
The modified genlight object
}
\description{
The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
some individuals are removed from the dataset and so the initial statistics
will no longer apply. This applies also to some variable calculated by dartR
(e.g. maf). This script resets the locus metrics flags to FALSE to indicate
that these statistics in the genlight object are no longer current. The
verbosity default is also set, and in the case of SilcoDArT, the flags PIC
and OneRatio are also set.
}
\details{
If the locus metrics do not exist then they are added to the genlight object
 but not populated. If the locus metrics flags do not exist, then they are
 added to the genlight object and set to FALSE (or TRUE).
