\description{
This script takes a G matrix generated by gl.grm() and represents the relationship among the specimens as a network diagram. In order to use this script,
a decision is required on a threshold for relatedness to be represented as link in the network, and on the layout used to create the diagram.
}
\details{
The threshold for relatedness to be represented as a link in the network is specified as a quantile. Those relatedness measures above the quantile are
plotted as links, those below the quantile are not. Often you are looking for relatedness outliers in comparison with the overall relatedness among individuals,
so a very conservative quantile is used (e.g. 0.004), but ultimately, this decision is made as a matter of trial and error. One way to approach this trial and error
is to try to achieve a sparse set of links between unrelated 'background' individuals so that the stronger links are preferentially shown.

There are several layouts from which to choose. The most popular are given as options in this script.
