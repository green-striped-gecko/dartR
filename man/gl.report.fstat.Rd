\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP or presence/absence
(SilicoDArT) data [required].}

\item{nboots}{Number of bootstraps [default 0].}

\item{conf}{Confident intervals [default 0.95].}

\item{parallel}{The type of parallel operation to be used (if any). If 
missing, the default is taken from the option "boot.parallel" (and if that is
 not set, "no").}

\item{ncpus}{Number of processes to be used in parallel operation: typically
one would chose this to the number of available CPUs [default 1].}

\item{digits}{Number of Digits to use [default 4].}

\item{plot.stat}{Statistic to plot. One of "Ho","Hs","Ht","Dst","Htp","Dstp",
"Fst","Fstp","Fis","Dest","Gst_max","Gst_H" [default "Fst"].}

\item{plot.display}{If TRUE, histograms of base composition are displayed in 
the plot window
[default TRUE].}

\item{plot.theme}{Theme for the plot. See Details for options
[default theme_dartR()].}

\item{plot.colors}{List of two color names for the borders and fill of the
plots [default gl.select.colors(library="brewer",palette="Blues",select=c(7,5))].}

\item{plot.file}{Name for the RDS binary file to save (base name only, exclude extension) [default NULL]}

\item{plot.dir}{Directory in which to save files [default = working directory]}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
 [default NULL, unless specified using gl.set.verbosity]}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to function \link[gplots]{heatmap.2},
such as width and height, when the ggplot is to be saved.}

\description{
Reports various statistics of genetic differentiation between populations
}
\details{
Even though FST and its relatives can predict evolutionary processes 
 (Holsinger & Weir, 2009), they are not true measures of genetic
  differentiation in the sense that they are dependent on the diversity
   within populations (Meirmans & Hedrick, 2011), the number of populations 
   analysed (Alcala & Rosenberg, 2017) and are not monotonic 
   (Sherwin et al., 2017). Recent approaches have been developed to 
   accommodate these mathematical restrictions (G'ST and Jost's D; Hedrick, 
   2005; Jost, 2008). More recently, novel approaches based on information 
   theory (Mutual Information; Sherwin et al., 2017) and allele frequencies 
   (Allele Frequency Difference; Berner, 2019) have distinct properties that
    make them valuable resources to interpret genetic differentiation. 
    
    Note that each measure of genetic differentiation has advantages and 
    drawbacks, and the decision of using a particular measure is usually 
    based on the research question.

 \strong{Bootstrapping}
 
Efron (1979) suggested that Bootstraps should be at least 200.

 A color vector can be obtained with gl.select.colors() and then passed to the function
 with the plot.colors parameter.
Themes can be obtained from in \itemize{
 \item \url{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html} and \item
 \url{https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/}
 }
If a plot.file is given, the ggplot arising from this function is saved as an "RDS"
binary file using saveRDS(); can be reloaded with readRDS(). A file name must be
specified for the plot to be saved.
 If a plot directory (plot.dir) is specified, the ggplot binary is saved to that
 directory; otherwise to the tempdir().
