\title{Compute and compare AIC for different fasimcoal models}
\usage{
AIC.comp(dir.in)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir.in}{The parent directory within which the models have been run}
}
\description{
This functions expects that different fastsimcoal models were run in
different directories within the same parent directory (as for
\code{fsc.multiple.estimate}). Assuming that \code{dir.in} is the parent
directory, it will extract and compute AIC from all of them.
}
\details{
It is important to note that this function will probably fail if there are
more than one .est within each directory as it will read these to evaluate
the number of parameters in the model. If there is more than one file, there
is no way to know which one is correct. Also, that will also create an
inconsistency between the number of models and the number of files, which may
cause problems in reporting the results even if the function completes.
