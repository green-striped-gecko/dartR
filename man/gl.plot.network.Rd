\description{
This script takes a distance matrix generated by dist() and represents the
relationship among the specimens as a network diagram. In order to use this
script, a decision is required on a threshold for relatedness to be
represented as link in the network, and on the layout used to create the
diagram.
}
\details{
The threshold for relatedness to be represented as a link in the network is
specified as a quantile. Those relatedness measures above the quantile are
plotted as links, those below the quantile are not. Often you are looking for
relatedness outliers in comparison with the overall relatedness among
individuals, so a very conservative quantile is used (e.g. 0.004), but
ultimately, this decision is made as a matter of trial and error. One way to
approach this trial and error is to try to achieve a sparse set of links
between unrelated 'background' individuals so that the stronger links are
preferentially shown.

There are several layouts from which to choose. The most popular are given as
options in this script.
