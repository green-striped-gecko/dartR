\title{A utility script to recalculate the frequency of the heterozygous SNPs by
locus after some populations have been deleted}
\usage{
utils.recalc.freqhets(x, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2].}
}
\value{
The modified genlight object.
}
\description{
The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHets included, but the frequency
 of the heterozygotes will change when some individuals are removed from the
 dataset.
}
\details{
This script recalculates the FreqHets and places these recalculated values in
 the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote reference SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.
