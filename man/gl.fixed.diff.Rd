\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing SNP genotypes or tag P/A data
(SilicoDArT) or an object of class 'fd' [required].}

\item{tloc}{Threshold defining a fixed difference (e.g. 0.05 implies 95:5 vs
5:95 is fixed) [default 0].}

\item{test}{If TRUE, calculate p values for the observed fixed differences
[default FALSE].}

\item{delta}{Threshold value for the true population minor allele frequency
(MAF) from which resultant sample fixed differences are considered true
positives [default 0.02].}

\item{alpha}{Level of significance used to display non-significant
differences between populations as they are compared pairwise [default 0.05].}

\item{reps}{Number of replications to undertake in the simulation to estimate
probability of false positives [default 1000].}

\item{mono.rm}{If TRUE, loci that are monomorphic across all individuals are
removed before beginning computations [default TRUE].}

\item{pb}{If TRUE, show a progress bar on time consuming loops
[default FALSE].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}

\value{
A list of Class 'fd' containing the gl object and square matrices,
as follows:
\enumerate{
       \item $gl -- the output genlight object;
       \item $fd -- raw fixed differences;
       \item $pcfd -- percent fixed differences;
       \item $nobs -- mean no. of individuals used in each comparison;
       \item $nloc -- total number of loci used in each comparison;
       \item $expfpos -- if test=TRUE, the expected count of false positives
       for each comparison [by simulation];
       \item $sdfpos -- if test=TRUE, the standard deviation of the count of
       false positives for each comparison [by simulation];
       \item $prob -- if test=TRUE, the significance of the count of fixed
       differences [by simulation])
        }

\description{
This script takes SNP data or sequence tag P/A data grouped into populations
in a genlight object (DArTSeq) and generates a matrix of fixed differences
between populations taken pairwise
}
\details{
A fixed difference at a locus occurs when two populations share no alleles or
where all members of one population has a sequence tag scored, and all
members of the other population has the sequence tag absent. The challenge
with this approach is that when sample sizes are finite, fixed differences
will occur through sampling error, compounded when many loci are examined.
Simulations suggest that sample sizes of n1=5 and n2=5 are adequate to reduce
the probability of [experiment-wide] type 1 error to negligible levels
[ploidy=2]. A warning is issued if comparison between two populations
involves sample sizes less than 5, taking into account allele drop-out.

Optionally, if test=TRUE, the script will test the fixed differences between
final OTUs for statistical significance, using simulation, and then further
amalgamate populations that for which there are no significant fixed
differences at a specified level of significance (alpha). To avoid conflation
of true fixed differences with false positives in the simulations, it is
necessary to decide a threshold value (delta) for extreme true allele
frequencies that will be considered fixed for practical purposes. That is,
fixed differences in the sample set will be considered to be positives (not
false positives) if they arise from true allele frequencies of less than
1-delta in one or both populations.  The parameter delta is typically set to
be small (e.g. delta = 0.02).

NOTE: The above test will only be calculated if tloc=0, that is, for analyses
of absolute fixed differences. The test applies in comparisons of allopatric
 populations only. For sympatric populations, use gl.pval.sympatry().

An absolute fixed difference is as defined above. However, one might wish to
score fixed differences at some lower level of allele frequency difference,
say where percent allele frequencies are 95,5 and 5,95 rather than 100:0 and
0:100. This adjustment can be done with the tloc parameter. For example,
tloc=0.05 means that SNP allele frequencies of 95,5 and 5,95 percent will be
regarded as fixed when comparing two populations at a locus.
