\value{
The reduced genlight object, if parentals are provided; output of
 NewHybrids is saved to the working directory.
}
\description{
This function compares two sets of parental populations to identify loci that
exhibit a fixed difference, returns an genlight object with the reduced
data, and creates an input file for the program NewHybrids using the top 200
(or hard specified loc.limit) loci. In the absence of two identified
parental populations, the script will select a random set 200 loci only
(method='random') or the first 200 loci ranked on information content
(method='AvgPIC').

A fixed difference occurs when a SNP allele is present in all individuals
of one population and absent in the other. There is provision for setting
a level of tolerance, e.g. threshold = 0.05 which considers alleles present
at greater than 95% in one population and less than 5% in the other to be
a fixed difference. Only the 200 loci are retained, because of limitations
of NewHybids.

If you specify a directory for the NewHybrids executable file, then the
script will create the input file from the SNP data then run NewHybrids. If
the directory is set to NULL, the execution will stop once the input file
(default='nhyb.txt') has been written to disk. Note: the executable option
will not work on a Mac; Mac users should generate the NewHybrids input file
and run this on their local installation of NewHybrids.

Refer to the New Hybrids manual for further information on the parameters to
set

It is important to stringently filter the data on RepAvg and CallRate if
using the random option. One might elect to repeat the analysis
(method='random') and combine the resultant posterior probabilities should
200 loci be considered insufficient.

The F1 individuals should be homozygous at all loci for which the parental
populations are fixed and different, assuming parental populations have been
specified. Sampling errors can result in this not being the case, especially
where the sample sizes for the parental populations are small. Alternatively,
the threshold for posterior probabilities used to determine assignment
(pprob) or the definition of a fixed difference (threshold) may be too lax.
To assess the error rate in the determination of assignment of F1
individuals, a plot of the frequency of homozygous reference, heterozygotes
and homozygous alternate (SNP) can be produced by setting plot=TRUE (the
default).
