\title{Subsample n loci from a genlight object and return as a genlight object}
\usage{
gl.subsample.loci(x, n, method = "random", mono.rm = FALSE, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{n}{Number of loci to include in the subsample [required]}

\item{method}{-- Method: "random", in which case the loci are sampled at random; or avgPIC, in which case the top n loci
ranked on information content (AvgPIC) are chosen [default 'random']}

\item{mono.rm}{-- Delete monomorphic loci before sampling [default FALSE]}

\item{verbose}{-- Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 
3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity]}
}
\value{
A genlight object with n loci
}
\description{
This is a support script, to subsample a genlight \{adegenet\} object based on loci. Two methods are used
to subsample, random and based on information content (avgPIC).
}
\examples{
# SNP data
  gl2 <- gl.subsample.loci(testset.gl, n=200, method="pic")
# Tag P/A data
  gl2 <- gl.subsample.loci(testset.gl, n=100, method="random")
