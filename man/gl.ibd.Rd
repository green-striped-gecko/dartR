\usage{
gl.ibd(
  x = NULL,
  distance = "Fst",
  coordinates = "latlon",
  Dgen = NULL,
  Dgeo = NULL,
  Dgeo_trans = "Dgeo",
  Dgen_trans = "Dgen",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Genlight object. If provided a standard analysis on Fst/1-Fst and
log(distance) is performed [required].}

\item{distance}{Type of distance that is calculated and used for the
analysis. Can be either population based 'Fst' [\link[StAMPP]{stamppFst}],
'D' [\link[StAMPP]{stamppNeisD}] or individual based 'propShared',
 [gl.propShared], 'euclidean' [gl.dist.ind, method='Euclidean']
 [default "Fst"].}

\item{coordinates}{Can be either 'latlon', 'xy' or a two column data.frame
with column names 'lat','lon', 'x', 'y'). Coordinates are provided via
\code{gl@other$latlon} ['latlon'] or via \code{gl@other$xy} ['xy']. If latlon
data will be projected to meters using Mercator system [google maps] or if
xy then distance is directly calculated on the coordinates.}

\item{Dgen}{Genetic distance matrix if no genlight object is provided
[default NULL].}

\item{Dgeo}{Euclidean distance matrix if no genlight object is provided
[default NULL].}

\item{Dgeo_trans}{Transformation to be used on the Euclidean distances. See
Dgen_trans [default "Dgeo"].}

\item{Dgen_trans}{You can provide a formula to transform the genetic
distance. The transformation can be applied as a formula using Dgen as the
 variable to be transformed. For example: \code{Dgen_trans = 'Dgen/(1-Dgen)'.
  Any valid R expression can be used here
   [default 'Dgen', which is the identity function.]}}

\item{permutations}{Number of permutations in the Mantel test [default 999].}

\item{plot.out}{Should an isolation by distance plot be returned
[default TRUE].}

\item{paircols}{Should pairwise dots colored by 'pop'ulation/'ind'ividual
pairs [default 'pop']. You can color pairwise individuals by pairwise
 population colors.}

\item{plot_theme}{Theme for the plot. See details for options
[default theme_dartR()].}

\item{save2tmp}{If TRUE, saves any ggplots and listings to the session
temporary directory (tempdir) [default FALSE].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
Returns a list of the following components: Dgen (the genetic
distance matrix), Dgeo (the Euclidean distance matrix), Mantel (the
statistics of the Mantel test).
}
\description{
This function performs an isolation by distance analysis based on a Mantel
test and also produces an isolation by distance plot. If a genlight object
with coordinates is provided, then an Euclidean and genetic distance matrices
are calculated.'
}
\details{
Currently pairwise Fst and D between populations and
1-propShared and Euclidean distance between individuals are
implemented. Coordinates are expected as lat long and converted to Google
Earth Mercator projection. If coordinates are already projected, provide them
at the x@other$xy slot.

You can provide also your own genetic and Euclidean distance matrices. The
function is based on the code provided by the adegenet tutorial
(\url{http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/files/tutorial-basics.pdf}),
using the functions  \link[vegan]{mantel} (package vegan),
\link[StAMPP]{stamppFst}, \link[StAMPP]{stamppNeisD} (package StAMPP) and
gl.propShared or gl.dist.ind. For transformation you need to have the dismo
package installed. As a new feature you can plot pairwise relationship using
double colored points (paircols=TRUE). Pairwise relationship can be
visualised via populations or individuals, depending which distance is
calculated. Please note: Often a problem arises, if an individual based 
distance is calculated (e.g. propShared) and some individuals have identical
 coordinates as this results in distances of zero between those pairs of 
 individuals.
 
If the standard transformation [log(Dgeo)] is used, this results in an 
infinite value, because of trying to calculate'log(0)'. To avoid this, the 
easiest fix is to change the transformation from log(Dgeo) to log(Dgeo+1) or 
you could add some "noise" to the coordinates of the individuals (e.g. +- 1m,
 but be aware if you use lat lon then you rather want to add +0.00001 degrees
  or so).
